# Asteroids
Clone of the arcade game Asteroids  
My first sizable python/pygame project  
Features saved high scores and savable game options
  
This version is almost the same as the version I finished back in December 2018, but updated to include the new version of my pygame extension script (which now gives things like a hover state for buttons)
